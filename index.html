		<p>
		My name is Abdel Salam Abbo,i am almost 21 years old.I am from Cameroon(a bilingual country) and from the 
		northern part particularly. I did my whole primary and secondary studies in French because of the dominance 
		of this language in our area. I first started my primary school in Garoua(my hometown 
		and the capital city of the northern region) and few months later we travelled to the far north region(Maroua city).
		There i completed my primary school and started my secondary school upto from 4.Then we came back to our hometown 
		and completed my secondary school. After graduating my College i decided to continue my studies in English language 
		since i belong to a bilingual country.Then an opportinuty showed up for a Scholarship in Bangladesh 
		at the Islamic University of Technology, a subsidiary organ of the islamic cooperation. I applied and Alhamdulillah i got admited.
		Upto now i am pursuing my courses in Computer Science and Engineering.
